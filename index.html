		<h2> Space Math </h2>
		<b>Instructions:</b><br>
		You have gained control of an alien spacecraft. There's only one problem: the aliens are math fanatics <br>
		and their spacecraft can only be controlled using math equations...  Adjust the parameters of the math equation <br>
		in the console using the arrow buttons and maneuver the spacecraft to gather the alien energy balls which, luckily, <br>
		are also laid out in the path of math equations!<br>
		The x exponent parameter ranges from 0 to 4; other parameters range -3 to 3.<br> 
		Click "GO" and your spinning spacecraft will travel along the equation graph collecting the black & light blue energy balls.<br>
		For your first hundred energy balls, the equation will be plotted in red in the console window.  After that you<br>
		will enter advanced mode and the plot will not be displayed.<br>
